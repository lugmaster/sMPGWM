## Coding Guidelines
- Keep comments minimal and useful; never include icons or emojis in code comments.
- Prefer `var` when type inference is possible and practical.
- Avoid LINQ operations; prefer straightforward loops.
- Prefer arrays and efficient, allocation-conscious implementations where appropriate.
- Favor fast, clear implementations without unnecessary overhead.
- Use one file per class/enum/record except for internal classes that are embedded in another class. Exception: Icons.*
- Each file should reflect its namespace, so that it can be properly imported!
